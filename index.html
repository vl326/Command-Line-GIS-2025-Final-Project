    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This project examines "Food Deserts" in Camden County—areas defined by the USDA as having both low income 
        and low access to nutritious food. By overlaying demographic and transit data, we attempt to understand 
        the characteristics of these communities and identify gaps in the local infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Sources & Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Sources:</strong> The analysis relies on three primary datasets. First, <strong>USDA Food Access Research Atlas</strong> data 
        was used to identify census tracts designated as food deserts based on income and distance to supermarkets. 
        Second, <strong>US Census Bureau (ACS 2019)</strong> data provided demographic context, specifically median household income 
        and racial composition. Finally, <strong>NJ Transit Open Data</strong> was utilized to plot bus stop locations 
        to analyze public transportation accessibility in these high-need areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Methodology:</strong> Data was processed using Python (Pandas/Geopandas). We merged the USDA food desert 
        flags with Census shapefiles to create the base choropleth layers. Demographic variables were normalized 
        and mapped to visualize correlations between race, income, and food access. NJ Transit stops were overlaid 
        as point data to calculate the density of transit options within identified food deserts.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> There is a definitive spatial overlap between low-income tracts and food deserts.</li>
        <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Food deserts in Camden County disproportionately affect neighborhoods with higher percentages of Black residents.</li>
        <li><strong>The Transit Paradox:</strong> While the urban center of Camden has the highest density of bus stops, it also contains the highest concentration of food deserts. This suggests that while transit is <em>available</em>, it may not effectively connect residents to nutritious food sources outside their immediate neighborhood.</li>
    </ul>
