        <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project examines "food deserts" in Camden County - areas defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as having both low income and low access to nutritious food.
           By overlaying demographic and transit data, we attempt to examine the characteristics of these communities.</p>

        <h2>4. Dataset Discussion</h2>

        For this final project, Ahmad and I gathered a few different datasets: our primary dataset was the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas">
        <strong>Food Access Research Atlas</strong></a>, prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service and last updated in 2019. This is 
        an .xlsx file that tracks food deserts across the entire U.S., which we first filtered out into a new .xlsx that only contained entries related to New Jersey.
        From there, we filtered our dataset in Colab to Camden County, which had a good variance in food deserts across census tracts and many food deserts related to vehicle-access
        issues.<br><br>
        
        We used New Jersey tract-level <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html"><strong>Cartographic Boundary Files</strong></a>
        from the U.S. Census Bureau for 2019 as it matched the 2019 TIGER/Line shapefiles used in the FARA dataset, and performed a table join between the FARA dataset and
        the CB tract files using GEOID to link food access attibutes to the tract shapes.<br><br>

        We also used a variety of supplmentary datasets such as the <strong>American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates</strong> for 2015-2019, also from the U.S Census Bureau,
        which was a .csv file which we accessed through the <code>tidycensus</code> and <code>cenpy</code> libraries. The census data was instrumental in helping us build
        our static maps and interactive maps, as we examined median household income, demographics, poverty rates, and vehicle ownership, and joined ACS data to our Camden
        geodataframe. For the static maps on median household income (MHI) and percentage of Black American residents, we calculated CV ≥ 40 for both variables, and while the map
        on MHI turned up 0 unreliable tracts, we did find unreliable tracts and displayed them on our second static map with hatching. These two static maps generally 
        demonstrate a correlation between low MHI and living in a food desert, and proportion of Black American citizens with the same, providing the foundation for a more
        systemic analysis of poverty and its myriad compounding factors.<br><br>

        Our other supplementary datasets we used included NJ Transit bus stop data from the <a href="https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/fcb66a1ea358460bad1113e2d4ec2ec5_11/about"><strong>NJ Transit GIS Department</strong></a>,
        most recently updated for 2025. This .geojson we sourced from Professor Payne's provided class material, and we used this for our third static map on vehicle access
        by spatial joining this with census tract polygons to examine bus stop density in tracts. We were interested in seeing what kind of relationship existed in tracts
        with low vehicle access or those with low vehicle access and are food deserts, and were quite surprised to find that there seemed to be an inverse relationship - tracts
        that had low vehicle access and were food deserts had on average more NJ Transit bus stops than those that were merely low vehicle access. Of course, bus stop density
        does not indicate anything about bus line frequency or service quality, and further investigation into those might shed more light on this relationship.<br><br>

        The final dataset we used consisted of a list of food retailers that we pulled from <strong>OpenStreetMap (OSM)</strong> via the <code>osmnx</code> library,
        consisting of point data with retail tags, which we accessed in December 2025. Though convenient to be able to pull this data through jupyter notebook, OSM
        does not have the full breadth of coverage that its larger proprietary competitors like Google Maps have, and OSM might not have accounted for smaller retailers.
