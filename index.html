        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project explores the intersection of socioeconomic status and food access in Camden County, NJ, identifying areas where low income and low physical access to groceries overlap.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="data-methodology">
        <h2>Data Methodology</h2>
        <p><strong>Sources & Preparation:</strong> Data was sourced from the <strong>USDA Food Access Research Atlas</strong> (2019), the <strong>US Census Bureau</strong> (ACS 5-Year Estimates, 2015-2019), and <strong>NJ Transit Open Data</strong>. Census data was accessed via the <code>tidycensus</code> and <code>cenpy</code> libraries.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Processing:</strong> The original data was in GeoJSON and CSV formats[cite: 17]. To make the data mappable, we performed a <strong>spatial join</strong> between NJ Transit bus stop point data and Census Tract polygons to calculate transit density. We also aggregated retail points from OpenStreetMap using <code>osmnx</code>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quality & Reliability:</strong> We addressed data quality by filtering for <strong>Coefficient of Variation (CV)</strong>. Any Census variables with a $CV \ge 40$ were symbolized as "unreliable" or excluded to ensure statistical integrity[cite: 18, 21].</p>
